Two of India's biggest stock exchanges BSE and NSE, collectively clear trades combining to greater than 40,000 crores every day. As you might already be aware, a lot of trading happens on the basis of technical and fundamental analysis.
One of the most basic technical analysis used by a lot of stock traders is the Moving Average Method.
When the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is a signal to BUY, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a Golden Cross.
On the opposite when the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term moving average, it is a signal to SELL, as it indicates the trend is shifting down. It is sometimes referred to as the Death Cross.
The dataset provided here has been extracted from the NSE website. The Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 for six stocks Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS.
The stocks were analysed and a User Defined function was created that takes the date as input and returns the signal for that particular day (Buy/Sell/Hold) for the stock.
